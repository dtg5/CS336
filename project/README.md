I was thinking of creating a site that stores information about the maps from Calvin's map room. It would categorize maps by topography, geography, etc. A user would be able to submit new maps or retrieve existing ones. There should be more than enough there to fulfill the requirements of the course.

One other thing I considered was joining the person who wanted to try the museum project, so I'm open to that as well.
