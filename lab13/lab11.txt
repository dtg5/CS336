Exercise 11.1:

a. Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.

    ANSWER: Well if nothing else, the bundle.js file was somewhat comprehensible before. It no longer is, thanks to the minification/uglification. Otherwise, I can't really say that it feels all that different in design now.

b. List the optimizations you've configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then (*them?) in the deployed application files.

    ANSWER: As noted before, there is the minification/uglification and the stylus modifications. The very first lines of code in bundle.js are now some kind of error messages, ready to be thrown if something goes wrong with webpack I suppose.

Exercise 11.2:

a. What advantage is there is deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?

    ANSWER: Well for one thing, it might allow me to do fewer complete rebuilds. Every time I move between computers, I have to worry about downloading all of these dependencies again, which takes a while.

b. How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling it from the specified branch on GitHub)?

    ANSWER: Evidently it just runs npm install and npm start automatically and hey-presto, it runs!
