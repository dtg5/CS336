This sample code supports Calvin College CS 336 Unit 10: MongoDB.

The lab will upgrade the application from lab 9 to load data from mLab rather than a static text file. Be sure to set the mLab MongoDB password by setting the appropriate environment variable:

% export MONGO_PASSWORD=<the_class_password>

*Note from Daniel: I fiddled with this a fair amount to make sure it works well on Windows, so apologies if it ends up exploding on a Linux system.
