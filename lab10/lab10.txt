a. Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you've used before. Are there things that one can do that the other can't?

ANSWER:  Frankly, for me it is hard to tell. Both MongoDB and something like T-SQL can perform similar CRUD operations. SQL seems a bit more formal of course, but you could probably force either of them to mimic most of what the other can do.

b. You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?

ANSWER: The advantage would be faster read and write operations while maintaining compatibility with the online database, presumably. A disadvantage could be the multiplication of steps in work flow.

c. You've built a "sandbox" database on mLab. Could you use this for a production database? Why or why not?

ANSWER: MongoDB recommends against it, since there is no redundancy of the data. "Sandbox databases are unsuitable for 'production use'. Key considerations when running in production: High availability, Emergency support, Consistent and predictable performance, and Secure access and communication."
