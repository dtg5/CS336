This sample code supports Calvin College
[CS 336](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden)
[Unit 9: Webpack](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/09webpack/index.html).

The lab will upgrade the application from lab 8 to be modularized and
bundled using WebPack. In development mode, it will run:
- a development server on port 3001 to serve up the application (http://localhost:3001/).
- a proxy server on port 3000 to serve up data (http://localhost:3000/api/comments).

If versioning becomes a problem, use the explicit module version settings given
in `package.json`. Note that the scripts provided here are configured for Linux.
For Windows, you can run the backgrounded tasks individually.
