This sample code supports Calvin College CS 336 Unit 11: Heroku.

The lab will upgrade the application from lab 10 to deploy to Heroku using a git subtree branch. Look here for the running app:

We maintain this public version of the full repo because deploying from private GitHub repos is trickier.
