Exercise 6.1

a. Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above. If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case. List the Curl commands you used successfully.  

ANSWER:
Chrome developer tools, without the aid of any additional extensions, can only
show requests and responses based on the elements a browser can normally interact  
with.  For example, if you navigate to any URL, you can see the GET request in action, 
and if there is a form with POST, PUT, and DELETE features, the developer tools will
show those requests and the responses being made.

As for Curl, HEAD produced a "bad range" response, and it also printed out 
the Hello, * Express Route! message. I was able to successfully test GET at any URL, 
but of course I needed to specifically be on localhost:3000/user to get a good response 
to PUT, POST, and DELETE. LISTEN gives a response too, but the response code is empty.

b. What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?

ANSWER:
404 NOT FOUND, I would think.

Exercise 6.2

a. What HTTP methods do forms support?

ANSWER:
PUT, POST, AND DELETE.

b. How is the form data being passed back to the server and what syntactic form does it take? Is the data modified in any way?

ANSWER: 
The form data is being passed to the server as an HTTP request, syntactically javascript I think.
There isn't really anything to modify, but using cookie/set does create a cookie file.
