		<p><h2>Answers for the lab 3 exercises:</h2></p>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>3.1</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>Compare and contrast the purposes of Node.js and of Express.js:</h4></li>
					<p><h6>Node.js is a JavaScript-based framework that was evidently made using Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications, such as video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications.  Express is a Node-based framework which provides a set of features for web and mobile applications.  Node.js is like the coding 'engine' (the core programming mechanics), and Express provides a range of development tools for that engine.  Node has a module library from which Express is installed, where utility functions can be found for operating systems, file paths, and most of all, a network wrapper for server and client streams.</h6></p>
					<li><h4>Explain the purpose of the package.json file.</h4></li>
					<p><h6>A package.json file contains meta data about an app or module.  Our particular json package has server, dependency, and author information, as well as some script handling.</h6></p>
				</ul>
			<li><h3>3.1</h3></li>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>Explain the sense in which these files are “static”.</h4></li>
					<p><h6>These are the files that can give the page its structure and content.  They are 'static' in the sense that they can be delivered to the user without needing to be generated, modified, or processed.</h6></p>
					<li><h4>Determine whether the server continues to serve up the hello-world message and explain why this is the case.</h4></li>
					<p><h6>The server does not serve up that message any more, because I replaced res.send("Hello world!") with res.redirect("http://localhost:3000/index.html"), so now going to localhost:3000 redirects the user automatically to index.html.</h6></p>
